We have 6 categories to achieve Data Of Quality :
1. Accuracy & Correctness
2. Comparability
3. Completeness
4. Consistency
5. uniqueness
6. Comformaty

1. Accuracy & Correctness :
Check  that data is accurate
For Example :
Mobile Number should be of 11 digits
National ID should be of 14 digits

2. Comparability :
Checking Refrential Integrity
For Example :
checking that the FK in a "MASTER TABLE" really exists in a "LOOKUP TABLE"

3. Completeness :
Checking nullability across the row
For Example :
getting the columns that have nulls for each row

4. Consistency :
Checking the stability of every transaction table
For Example :
all FKs must have a unique PK
we shouldn't have two transactions having the same key

5. uniqueness :
Making sure that all PKs are unique
For Example:
In Lookup tables we shouldn't have same IDs to different descriptions
In Master tables we must have a unique Identifier

6. Comformaty :
Checking the formats of every datatype
For Example :
A data is entered in a date format
phone number having dashes
